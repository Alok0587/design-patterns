Need of Object pool-

 When creating some specific Object is expensive for Exp,
 creating DB connection(Used for pooling database connection) or creating threads.(check for java cached object pool class)
 This is used when creating object is really not efficient everytime and we want to
 Use already created objects from object pool.

 Notes- Not use this design pattern for creating object which are used for longer duration for the client.

 Implementation-

 1. create object which will be pooled
 2. create a interface which will allow to get and add to the pool.
 3. Use BlockingQueue<Object> for handling thread safety for the pooled object
 4. Borrow the object when used and after then release/return the object to BlockingQueue<>
