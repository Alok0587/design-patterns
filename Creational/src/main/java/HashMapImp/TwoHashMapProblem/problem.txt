To implement a caching mechanism using two HashMaps in Java,
 which will be accessed by multiple threads and delete data from the cache
 if its timestamp crosses a TTL (Time-To-Live) value


 //We will use ConcurrentHashMap for the thread safety



 Operations-
  1.Add new entry in cache
  2.Remove From Cache
  3. Clear the cache values after TTL
